      <h2>Recurring Medical Transportation, Done Right.</h2>
      <p>
        Many seniors and patients rely on random rideshare drivers for
        critical medical appointments. Different drivers, different cars,
        and uncertain timing can create unnecessary stress.

        <h3>Dialysis Visits</h3>
        <p>
          Dialysis happens multiple times a week and cannot be missed.
          We show up on time, every time, so transportation never puts
          care at risk.

          Chemotherapy days are physically and emotionally demanding.
          Having a familiar, reliable driver removes one critical
          source of stress.

      <h2>Built Around Showing Up</h2>
      <p>
        Care Mobility was created because too many seniors were missing or
        stressing over critical medical appointments. Reliable transportation
        existed, but dependable availability they could truly count on did not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built Care Mobility to solve that gap with familiar drivers,
        consistent schedules, and accountability that patients and families
        can rely on week after week.
