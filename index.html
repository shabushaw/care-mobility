      <h2>Recurring Medical Transportation, Done Right.</h2>
      <p>
        Many seniors and patients rely on inconsistent transportation
        for critical medical appointments. Different drivers, uncertain
        timing, and last-minute cancellations create unnecessary stress.

      <h2>Why Rideshare Isn’t Built for Recurring Medical Care</h2>

      <p class="rideshare-intro">
        Services like Uber and Lyft can be convenient and lower cost for
        everyday transportation. But for recurring medical appointments
        with strict schedules, rideshare options often fall short.
      </p>

      <div class="rideshare-grid">
        <div class="rideshare-item">
          <h3>Reliability</h3>
          <p>
            Rideshare availability depends on driver supply at the moment
            a ride is requested. For time-sensitive medical appointments,
            this uncertainty can create stress or missed care.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rideshare-item">
          <h3>Punctuality</h3>
          <p>
            Appointment pickups require precision. Rideshare ETAs can
            change due to traffic, cancellations, or last-minute driver
            reassignment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rideshare-item">
          <h3>Different Drivers Every Time</h3>
          <p>
            Each trip may involve a new driver unfamiliar with the patient,
            routine, or clinic location.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rideshare-item">
          <h3>Different Vehicles</h3>
          <p>
            Vehicle size, comfort, and ease of entry vary from ride to
            ride, which matters for patients with mobility challenges.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rideshare-item">
          <h3>Lower Cost, Lower Consistency</h3>
          <p>
            Rideshare may be less expensive for one-off trips, but that
            lower price often comes with less predictability and
            accountability over time.

          <h3>How Care Mobility Is Different</h3>
          <p>
            Care Mobility is built specifically for recurring medical care:
            familiar drivers, consistent schedules, and accountability you
            can rely on week after week.

        <p class="founder-lead">
          Care Mobility exists because too many seniors were missing or
          stressing over essential medical appointments — not because
          care wasn’t available, but because dependable transportation wasn’t.

        <p>
          Care Mobility was built to be different. Familiar drivers.
