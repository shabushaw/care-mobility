      <h2>A Simpler Alternative to Insurance-Based Medical Transportation</h2>

      <ul class="alt-bullets">
        <li>
          <strong>Insurance-based transportation adds friction</strong><br />
          Many services depend on <strong>Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance approvals</strong>,
          requiring paperwork, eligibility checks, and authorization workflows
          before rides can even be scheduled.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Delays hurt patients with recurring care</strong><br />
          For patients who need rides multiple times each week, insurance,
          Medicare, and Medicaid processes often introduce delays, missed
          appointments, and unnecessary stress.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Care Mobility does not rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance</strong><br />
          We operate independently of insurance networks, care advocates,
          and authorization requirements.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Technology-driven efficiency keeps pricing transparent</strong><br />
          By using sophisticated routing, scheduling, and customer experience
          technology, Care Mobility operates efficiently and offers clear,
          predictable pricing without insurance complexity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>No approvals. No middle layers.</strong><br />
          Just reliable, recurring transportation that starts quickly
          and stays consistent — week after week.

<!-- WHY -->
<section class="why">
  <div class="why-left">
    <h2>Why Reliable, Recurring<br>Transportation Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Many seniors don’t need transportation just once. They need it multiple
      times each week, often on a fixed and unforgiving schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      When rides are missed or delayed, appointments are skipped, treatments
      are disrupted, stress increases, and families and caregivers are forced
      to step in at the last minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Care Mobility is different.</strong> It’s designed specifically for
      recurring medical care, with predictable pickup times, familiar drivers,
      consistent routines, and fixed, transparent pricing — all without
      insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid paperwork.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="why-right">
    <div class="why-card">
      <strong>Rideshare is unpredictable</strong>
      <p>Pricing fluctuates, drivers change daily, and availability isn’t guaranteed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="why-card">
      <strong>Traditional medical transport is bureaucratic</strong>
      <p>Paperwork, insurance approvals, and long scheduling windows are common.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="why-card highlight">
      <strong>Care Mobility is patient-first</strong>
      <p>Same routines, familiar drivers, and dependable pickup times.</p>
