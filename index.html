      <h2>A Simpler Alternative to Insurance-Based Medical Transportation</h2>

      <ul class="alt-bullets flat">
        <li>
          <strong>Insurance-based transportation adds friction.</strong>
          Don't depend on Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance approvals,
          that require paperwork, eligibility checks, and authorization workflows
          before rides can even be scheduled.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Delays hurt patients with recurring care.</strong>
          For patients who need rides multiple times each week, insurance,
          Medicare, and Medicaid processes often introduce delays, missed
          appointments, and unnecessary stress.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Care Mobility does not rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance.</strong>
          We operate independently of insurance networks, care advocates,
          and authorization requirements.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Technology-driven efficiency keeps pricing transparent.</strong>
          By using sophisticated routing, scheduling, and customer experience
          technology, Care Mobility operates efficiently and offers clear,
          predictable pricing without insurance complexity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>No approvals. No middle layers.</strong>
          Just reliable, recurring transportation that starts quickly and
          stays consistent — week after week.

    <!-- LEFT: COPY -->
    <div class="alt-text">
      <h2>Why I started Care Mobility and our value</h2>

      <p>
        Care Mobility was created to meet a real need in healthcare:
        dependable medical transportation for seniors who want to stay
        independent — without placing extra burden on family or loved ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Too often, existing options create tradeoffs. Seniors face unreliable
        pickups, families scramble to adjust schedules, and stress builds
        around making sure care isn’t missed.
      </p>

      <p>
        We prioritize quality of service first: predictable pickup times,
        familiar drivers, calm assistance, and consistent routines that work
        week after week.
      </p>

      <p>
        By operating independently and using modern routing and scheduling
        technology, Care Mobility delivers reliable service at a fair,
        transparent price that’s often faster and simpler than traditional
        alternatives.
      </p>

      <p class="why-emphasis">
        Care Mobility isn’t just about rides.
        It’s about independence, reliability, and making recurring medical
        care easier for everyone involved.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Care Mobility</h2>

    <div class="faq-list">

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is Care Mobility covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or insurance?</h3>
        <p>
          Care Mobility is a private-pay service and does not bill Medicare,
          Medicaid, or insurance. This allows us to avoid approvals,
          paperwork, and delays that often interfere with recurring
          medical care and a compelling price to you.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why would I pay out of pocket for medical transportation?</h3>
        <p>
          Because getting to care on time cannot be compromised. For
          recurring treatments like dialysis, radiation, or therapy,
          missed or delayed rides can disrupt care plans, increase
          health risks, and create unnecessary stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Care Mobility is designed to prioritize consistency and
          reliability over administrative processing, which reduces 
          our costs and improves your experience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Isn’t insurance-based transportation cheaper?</h3>
        <p>
          Insurance-based transportation often appears cheaper, but the
          real cost shows up in delays, missed pickups, rescheduling,
          and time lost. Many families end up paying with frustration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does Care Mobility keep pricing reasonable?</h3>
        <p>
          Care Mobility uses advanced routing, scheduling, and customer
          experience technology to operate efficiently. By eliminating
          insurance processing and administrative overhead, we keep
          pricing transparent and predictable while delivering reliable
          service.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Who typically chooses Care Mobility?</h3>
        <p>
          Care Mobility is most often chosen by seniors, adult children,
          and caregivers who value reliability and consistency for
          recurring medical care and cannot risk missed or delayed
          appointments.
