      <h2>Recurring Medical Transportation, Done Right.</h2>
      <p>
        Many seniors and patients rely on inconsistent transportation
        for critical medical appointments. Different drivers, uncertain
        timing, and last-minute cancellations create unnecessary stress.

        <h3>Dialysis Visits</h3>

          Dialysis happens multiple times per week and cannot be missed.
          We provide consistent, on-time transportation you can rely on.

        <p class="founder-lead">
          Care Mobility exists because too many seniors were missing or
          stressing over essential medical appointments — not because
          care wasn’t available, but because dependable transportation wasn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw how unreliable pickup times, unfamiliar drivers, and
          cancellations created anxiety for patients and families already
          facing serious health challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Care Mobility was built to be different. Familiar drivers.
          Consistent schedules. Accountability you can count on —
          week after week.
