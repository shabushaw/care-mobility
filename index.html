        <h2>Why Care Mobility?</h2>
        <p>
          Most ride services are designed for one-time trips. Care Mobility is purpose-built for
          <strong>recurring medical transportation</strong> — giving you the same driver, consistent scheduling, and the peace of mind that comes from working with professionals who understand medical care logistics.
        </p>
        <p class="why-emphasis">
          "We don't just get you there. We become a dependable part of your care routine."
