      <h2>Recurring Medical Transportation, Done Right.</h2>
      <p>
        Many seniors and patients rely on random rideshare drivers for
        critical medical appointments. Different drivers, different cars,
        and uncertain timing can create unnecessary stress.

      <div class="service-card blue">
        <h3>Dialysis Visits</h3>
        <p>
          Dialysis happens multiple times a week and cannot be missed.
          We show up on time, every time, so transportation never puts
          care at risk.

        <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
        <p>
          Chemotherapy days are physically and emotionally demanding.
          Having a familiar, reliable driver removes one critical
          source of stress.

        <h2>Built Around Showing Up</h2>
        <p class="founder-lead">
          Care Mobility exists because too many seniors were missing or
          stressing over critical medical appointments — not because care
          wasn’t available, but because dependable transportation wasn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw firsthand how inconsistent pickup times, unfamiliar drivers,
          and last-minute cancellations created anxiety for patients and
          families already dealing with serious health challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Care Mobility was built to be different. Familiar drivers.
          Consistent schedules. Accountability you can count on — week
          after week, appointment after appointment.
