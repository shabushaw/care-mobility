      <h2>Recurring Medical Transportation, Done Right.</h2>
      <p>
        Many seniors and patients rely on inconsistent transportation
        for critical medical appointments. Different drivers, uncertain
        timing, and last-minute cancellations create unnecessary stress.

          Care Mobility exists because too many seniors were missing or
          stressing over essential medical appointments — not because
          care wasn’t available, but because dependable transportation wasn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          Care Mobility was built to be different. Familiar drivers.
          Consistent schedules. Accountability you can count on —
          week after week.
